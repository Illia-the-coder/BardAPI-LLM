### BardAPI-LLM

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that showcases the integration of the Bard API with the LangChain library. By combining the strengths of both platforms, we present a custom Language Learning Model (LLM) tailored for the Bard API, enabling users to tap into Bard's capabilities within the LangChain framework.

#### Features:
- **Custom Bard LLM**: A specialized class that interfaces with the Bard API, making it compatible with LangChain's LLM structure.
- **LangChain Integration**: Step-by-step demonstration of how to deploy the custom Bard LLM within LangChain's agent and tools.
- **Interactive Experience**: Execute the notebook for an interactive session, querying the Bard API through the integrated LLM.
